# 1. Introduction

------

Fastspeed is a platform based on Pytorch that accelerates model training on heterogeneous GPU clusters. The platform automatically assigns varying amounts of training data to different types of GPUs. This load balancing strategy allows more powerful GPUs to process more data examples, reducing communication overhead and ultimately improving training speed.
